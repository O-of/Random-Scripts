# Random Scripts That I Create

Get AP Videos
A simple script to download the AP Videos from AP Classroom.
Copy and paste code from `getapcourses.js` into the console of a classroom of your choice and wait until it outputs a string.
Put that string into classroom_data.json and run downloadvideo.py, remember to change the output_folder variable to whatever you want
